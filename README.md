# 🏗️ Structural Defects — AI-Assisted Structural Defect Identification System (GenAI)

An **AI-powered computer vision + Generative AI application** that analyzes construction site images to **detect, classify, and assess structural defects**, and generates a **professional inspection report** similar to what a civil/structural engineer would prepare.

Built using **Google Gemini (Vision + Prompt Engineering)** and **Streamlit**, this system converts raw site images into **actionable engineering insights**.

## 🔍 What This System Does

Upload an image of a structure (wall, beam, column, slab, etc.) and the system automatically generates a **detailed structural inspection report**, including:

- Identification of structural defects (cracks, spalling, corrosion, exposed reinforcement, etc.)
- Classification of each defect
- Severity assessment (Low / Medium / High)
- Potential structural and safety impact
- Estimated time before permanent damage
- Short-term and long-term repair solutions
- Approximate repair cost (INR) and implementation time
- Preventive measures to avoid future defects
- Engineer-style formatted report using bullets and tables

## 🧠 Key AI & Engineering Capabilities

- Multimodal **vision-based defect understanding**
- **Prompt engineering** to simulate structural engineer reasoning
- Detection of multiple defects from a single image
- Severity and risk prioritization
- Cost and time estimation logic
- Auto-generated inspection report format
